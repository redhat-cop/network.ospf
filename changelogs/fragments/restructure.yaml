  - summary: "Restructured the network.ospf collection by converting supported operations into separate roles."
    details: |
      The following changes were made to the `network.ospf` collection:
      - Converted operations like `persist`, `detect`, `remediate`, `deploy` and `health_checks` into individual roles for better modularity and clarity.
      - Each role (`persist`, `detect`, `remediate`, `deploy`, `gather`, `health_checks`) now has its own README.md and integration tests.
      - Updated all integration tests to align with the new role-based structure.
      - Improved documentation and usage examples for each role to reflect the restructuring.

      - deploy: "Now an independent role for deploying configurations based on inventory host_vars."
      - gather: "New role to collect and display structured facts for network resources."
